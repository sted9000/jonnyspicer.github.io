            I spend my days building C# applications using .NET, and then making them web-facing with the addition of
            (S)CSS and a little JavaScript (vanilla, where possible). I use MySQL to keep data at my fingertips
            and pry secrets from it, and Python for when I want something flexible that I can plumb straight into my command line. I think
            git is the
            greatest piece of software written (and I don't think it's especially close), and I harness the power and
            scalability of cloud
            platforms like Azure and AWS to make sure my code is where it needs to be, when it needs to be.

            I currently have the pleasure of working for <a href="https://cortex.gg/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">Cortex</a> but
            I'm open to taking on freelance opportunities, as well as pro bono work for registered charities. Shoot me
            an
            email
            - let's
            get a coffee and discuss how I can help.

            I spend my nights playing chess, climbing mountains, watching bad movies, listening to early-2000s post-punk
            and
            protecting Gotham.
            The item at the top of my bucket list is to go to space. I represented my university at DotA2, and I once
            persuaded
            an entire
            choir to sing the theme from Skyrim, very much in a made-up dragon language. My favourite place in the world
            is
            inside a sensory
            deprivation tank, I'm allergic to cats and the last film I cried at was Train to Busan.

            I like to use the internet like my journal. If you're that way inclined, you can read what I've written (all
            x
            words
            of it)
            by clicking below
