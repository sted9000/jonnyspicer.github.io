    I spend my days building scrumptious C# applications using .NET, and then making them web-facing with the addition
    of a dash of
    (S)CSS and a sprinkling of JavaScript (vanilla, where possible). I use MySQL to keep data at my fingertips and
    pry secrets from
    it, and Python for when I want something flexible that I can plumb straight into my command line. I think
    git is the
    greatest piece of software written (and I don't think it's especially close), and I harness the power and
    scalability of cloud
    platforms like Azure and AWS to make sure my code is where it needs to be, when it needs to be.

    I currently have the pleasure of working for <a href="https://cortex.gg/" target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer">Cortex</a> but
    I'm open to taking on freelance opportunities, as well as pro bono work for registered charities. Shoot me an email
    - let's
    get a coffee and discuss how I can help.

<p>
    I spend my nights playing chess, climbing mountains, watching bad movies, listening to early-2000s post-punk and
    protecting Gotham.
    The item at the top of my bucket list is to go to space. I represented my university at DotA2, and I once persuaded
    an entire
    choir to sing the theme from Skyrim, very much in a made-up dragon language. My favourite place in the world is
    inside a sensory
    deprivation tank, I'm allergic to cats and the last film I cried at was Train to Busan.

    Want to get to know me more?

    I like to use the internet like my journal. If you're that way inclined, you can read what I've written (all x words
    of it)
